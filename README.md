# Project Template

This project template is designed to streamline the process of creating and managing pages with Strapi. It provides two main modes for creating your pages:

- ## Strapi Page Generation

    - This mode allows you to create pages directly within Strapi. After the pages are created, you can easily add layouts to the sections using a `generator\`.

    - The generator simplifies the process by quickly generating layouts for different sections after they have been created in Strapi.

- ## Standard Template

    - If you prefer a simpler setup without the Strapi page generation, you can use the standard template.

    - To switch to this mode, simply delete the `generator\` folder in the root directory after installation.
